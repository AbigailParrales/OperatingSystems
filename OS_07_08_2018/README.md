# Assignment.-Lab-1.2---Code-Challenge

Description:
    These are my solutions to the coding challenges of my first Operating System course. The coding exercises are the following:
    
    Question 1:
        Find the first character in a String that doesn't repeat.
    Question 2:
      Create a data structure that allows the user to (1) add integers and (2) report the median.
    Question 3:
    Given an integer N and a sorted list of k distinct integers in the range 0 to N-1 inclusive, return a uniformly distributed random number from 0 to N-1 which is NOT on the list.
    
How to build/run:

    For running you need to run the next files:
    
      Question 1:Question1.java
      Question 2:Question2.java
              Note: You need to have the Heap.java class in the same folder that Question2.java
      Question 3:Question3.java
              Note: You need to have the BST.java class in the same folder that Question3.java
              
     Note: I recommend to use an IDE for running the classes since the IDE automatically compiles the class when you "run" the file. if you are willing to run this files from terminal, you must first compile the .java files with the command "javac"
